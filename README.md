# CSCI-8700-Pathfinder-CC
Project for CSCI 8700. Group members are J. Robbins, B. Hodges, B. Hawkins, and N. Sabata.

Purpose:

This project is a web page that allows users to fill out a Pathfinder 2E character sheet using the information held in our backend database through dropdown menus. Clicking save will allow the user to output the chosen information into a character sheet json file or allow the user print it out.

Usage:

Navigate to https://justinrobbins7.github.io/CSCI-8700-Pathfinder-CC/index.html to access the application. 

Fill in information on each tab to provide the system with information, then hit save to output a character sheet or a file.
